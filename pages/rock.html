  <h1 class="rockt">
    Rock is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in
    the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range
    of different styles from the mid-1960s, particularly in the United States
    and the United Kingdom. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a
    style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of
    African-American music and from country music. Rock also drew strongly from
    genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from
    jazz, classical, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has
    centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with
    electric bass guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is
    song-based music with a time signature using a verseâ€“chorus form, but the
    genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress
    romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are
    frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in
    the U.S. and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the 2010s.
