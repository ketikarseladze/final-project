  <h1 class="rockp">Hip Hop Music</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Hip-hop or hip hop, also known as rap, and formerly known as disco rap, is a
    genre of popular music that originated in the early 1970s by African
    Americans and Caribbean immigrants in the Bronx, a borough of New York City.
    Hip-hop music originated as an anti-drug and anti-violence genre consisting
    of stylized rhythmic music (usually built around drum beats) that often
    accompanies rapping, a rhythmic delivery of poetic speech. According to the
    professor Asante of African American studies at Temple University, "hip hop
    is something that blacks can unequivocally claim as their own". The music
    developed as part of the broader hip hop culture, a subculture defined by
    four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with
    turntables, breakdancing, and graffiti art. While often used to refer solely
    to rapping and rap music, "hip hop" more properly denotes the practice of
    the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously
    with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip
    hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of the culture,
    including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental
    tracks.
