  <h1 class="rockp">Classical Music</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Classical music generally refers to the art music of the Western world,
    considered to be distinct from Western folk music or popular music
    traditions. It is sometimes distinguished as Western classical music, as the
    term "classical music" can also be applied to non-Western art musics.
    Classical music is often characterized by formality and complexity in its
    musical form and harmonic organization, particularly with the use of
    polyphony. Since at least the ninth century it has been primarily a written
    tradition, spawning a sophisticated notational system, as well as
    accompanying literature in analytical, critical, historiographical,
    musicological and philosophical practices. A foundational component of
    Western culture, classical music is frequently seen from the perspective of
    individual or groups of composers, whose compositions, personalities and
    beliefs have fundamentally shaped its history.
