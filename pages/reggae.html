  <h1 class="rockp">Reggae</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The
    term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A
    1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, "Do the Reggay", was the first popular
    song to use the word reggae, effectively naming the genre and introducing it
    to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most
    types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes
    a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento
    as well as by American jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the
    earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social
    gossip, and political commentary. It is instantly recognizable from the
    counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm
    section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from
    the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.
