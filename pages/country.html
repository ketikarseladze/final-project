  <h1 class="rockp">Country Music</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Country (also called country and western) is a music genre originating in
    the Southern and Southwestern United States. First produced in the 1920s,
    country music primarily focuses on working class Americans and blue-collar
    American life. Country music is known for its ballads and dance tunes (also
    known as "honky-tonk music") with simple form, folk lyrics, and harmonies
    generally accompanied by instruments such as banjos, fiddles, harmonicas,
    and many types of guitar (including acoustic, electric, steel, and resonator
    guitars). Though it is primarily rooted in various forms of American folk
    music, such as old-time music and Appalachian music, many other traditions,
    including, Mexican, Irish, and Hawaiian music, have also had a formative
    influence on the genre. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout
    its history as well. The term country music gained popularity in the 1940s
    in preference to hillbilly music; it came to encompass western music, which
    evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th
    century. Contemporary styles of western music include Texas country, red
    dirt, and Hispano- and Mexican American-led Tejano and New Mexico music, all
    extant alongside longstanding indigenous traditions.
