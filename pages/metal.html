  <h1 class="rockp">Heavy Metal</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the
    late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and United States.
    With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock and acid rock, heavy metal bands
    developed a thick, monumental sound characterized by distorted guitars,
    extended guitar solos, emphatic beats and loudness. In 1968, three of the
    genre's most famous pioneers – British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and
    Deep Purple – were founded. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they
    were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal
    into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock
    rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the
    flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen. During the mid-1970s, Judas
    Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues
    influence, while Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an
    increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new
    wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a
    similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as
    "metalheads" or "headbangers". The lyrics of some metal genres became
    associated with aggression and machismo, an issue that has at times led to
    accusations of misogyny.
