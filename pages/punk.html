  <h1 class="rockp">Punk Rock</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Punk rock (also known as simply punk) is a music genre that emerged in the
    mid-1970s. Rooted in 1950s rock and roll and 1960s garage rock, punk bands
    rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock music. They
    typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and
    singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often shouted political,
    anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands
    self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record
    labels. The term "punk rock" was previously used by American rock critics in
    the early 1970s to describe the mid-1960s garage bands. Certain late 1960s
    and early 1970s Detroit acts, such as MC5 and Iggy and the Stooges, and
    other bands from elsewhere created out-of-the-mainstream music that became
    highly influential on what was to come. Glam rock in the UK and the New York
    Dolls from New York have also been cited as key influences. Between 1974 and
    1976, when the genre that became known as punk was developing, prominent
    acts included Television, Patti Smith, and the Ramones in New York City; the
    Saints in Brisbane; and the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned in
    London, and the Buzzcocks in Manchester. By late 1976, punk had become a
    major cultural phenomenon in the UK. It gave rise to a punk subculture that
    expressed youthful rebellion through distinctive styles of clothing, such as
    T-shirts with deliberately offensive graphics, leather jackets, studded or
    spiked bands and jewellery, safety pins, and bondage and S&M clothes.
