  <h1 class="rockp">Latin Music</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Latin music (Portuguese and Spanish: m√∫sica latina) is a term used by the
    music industry as a catch-all category for various styles of music from
    Ibero-America, which encompasses Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and the
    Latino population in Canada and the United States, as well as music that is
    sung in either Spanish and/or Portuguese. Because the majority of Latino
    immigrants living in New York City in the 1950s were of Puerto Rican or
    Cuban descent, "Latin music" had been stereotyped as music simply
    originating from the Spanish Caribbean. The popularization of bossa nova and
    Herb Alpert's Mexican-influenced sounds in the 1960s did little to change
    the perceived image of Latin music. Since then, the music industry
    classifies all music sung in Spanish or Portuguese as Latin music, including
    musics from Spain and Portugal.
