  <h1 class="rockp">Pop Music</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form
    during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. During the
    1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented
    styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until
    the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more
    commercial, ephemeral, and accessible. Identifying factors of pop music
    usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs
    written in a basic format (often the verseâ€“chorus structure), and rhythms or
    tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements
    from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country. The terms
    popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the
    former more accurately describes all music that is popular and includes many
    disparate styles. Although much of the music that appears on record charts
    is considered to be pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music.
