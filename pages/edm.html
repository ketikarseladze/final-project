  <h1 class="rockp">Electronic Dance Music</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Electronic dance music (EDM) is a broad range of percussive electronic music
    genres originally made for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. It is generally
    produced for playback by DJs who create seamless selections of tracks,
    called a DJ mix, by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers
    also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is
    sometimes called a live PA. Since its inception EDM has expanded to include
    a wide range of subgenres. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the
    emergence of raving, pirate radio, PartyCrews, underground festivals and an
    upsurge of interest in club culture, EDM achieved mainstream popularity in
    Europe. However, rave culture was not as broadly popular in the United
    States; it was not typically seen outside of the regional scenes in New York
    City, Florida, the Midwest, and California. Although both electro and
    Chicago house music were influential both in Europe and the United States,
    mainstream media outlets and the record industry remained openly hostile to
    it. There was also a perceived association between EDM and drug culture,
    which led governments at state and city levels to enact laws and policies
    intended to halt the spread of rave culture. Subsequently, in the new
    millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, particularly in the
    United States and Australia. By the early 2010s, the term "electronic dance
    music" and the initialism "EDM" was being pushed by the American music
    industry and music press in an effort to rebrand American rave culture.
    Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the acronym
    remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop,
    house, techno, electro and trance, as well as their respective subgenres.
