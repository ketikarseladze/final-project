  <h1 class="rockp">Techno Music</h1>
  <h1 class="rockt">
    Techno is a genre of electronic dance music (EDM) which is generally
    produced for use in a continuous DJ set, with tempo often varying between
    120 and 150 beats per minute (bpm). The central rhythm is typically in
    common time (4/4) and often characterized by a repetitive four on the floor
    beat. Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines,
    sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations. Drum
    machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly
    prized, and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular. Much
    of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other
    musical parameters. Techno tracks mainly progress over manipulation of
    timbral characteristics of synthesizer presets and, unlike forms of EDM that
    tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards, techno does not always
    strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of Western music and such
    structures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone. Another
    distinguishing feature of techno music and techno aesthetic is the general
    embracement of creative use of music production technology.
