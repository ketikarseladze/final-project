  <h1 class="rockt">
    Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of
    New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its
    roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized
    as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz
    is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response
    vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in European harmony
    and African rhythmic rituals. As jazz spread around the world, it drew on
    national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different
    styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass
    band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective
    polyphonic improvisation. But jazz did not begin as a single musical
    tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented
    swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational
    style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the
    prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable
    popular music toward a more challenging "musician's music" which was played
    at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz
    developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and
    long, linear melodic lines.
