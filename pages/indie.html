  <h1 class="rockt">
    Indie rock is a subgenre of rock music that originated in the United
    Kingdom, United States and New Zealand in the early to mid-1980s. Although
    the term was originally used to describe rock music released through
    independent record labels, by the 1990s it became more widely associated
    with the music such bands produced. The sound of indie rock has its origins
    in the New Zealand Dunedin sound of the Chills, Sneaky Feelings, Tall
    Dwarfs, the Clean and the Verlaines, and early 1980s college rock radio
    stations who would frequently play jangle pop bands like the Smiths and
    R.E.M. The genre solidified itself during the midâ€“1980s with NME's C86
    cassette in the United Kingdom and the underground success of Sonic Youth,
    Dinosaur Jr. and Unrest in the United States. By this time, "indie" had
    become used to refer to bands whose music was released on independent record
    labels, in addition to the record labels themselves. As the decade
    progressed many individual local scenes developed their own distinct takes
    on the genre: baggy in Manchester; grebo in Stourbridge and Leicester; and
    shoegaze in London and the Thames Valley.
